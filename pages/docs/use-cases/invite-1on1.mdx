Find a mutually available time with another person, add the event to Google Calendar, and notify via Slack. Then, create a workflow for this process to make it reusable.

### Step 1

Register or log in on the product page. (https://studio-pro.wrtn.ai)

<br />

### Step 2

In the prompt field, type a request to schedule a meeting with a specific person (include their email), specify the timeframe for the meeting (e.g., next week between certain days), and ask to add it to Google Calendar.

### Step 3

If a prompt appears asking you to connect your account to a specific service to perform the requested actions (e.g., viewing and creating events), simply click the dropdown menu and select the connected account. (If the service connector has not been connected before, an account authentication process will be required.)

### Step 4

Check the intermediate results as the AI agent performs actions based on your request, then provide approval or additional comments to proceed.

If all the requested actions have been completed, ask to create an automated workflow for the task.

If the AI agent creates a workflow, click the ‘Go to Workflow’ button to navigate to the Workflow Canvas.

<br />

### Step 7

Click on the nodes of the created workflow to modify their detailed properties in Inspector. (For example, delete the email address entered in the previous conversation and input the email address of the new person to invite.)
