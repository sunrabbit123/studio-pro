# Core Elements

- **Interactive and User-Friendly Interface**: The user-friendly agentic interface that allows users to communicate and view the execution process of the Studio autonomous agent in the form of a workflow.
- **Workflow**: The execution path designed by the Studio autonomous agent to achieve the user's desired goals, broken down into actionable units.
- **Workflow Canvas**: A drag-and-drop low-code editor that visualizes the design and action-level execution paths created by the Studio autonomous agent. Connector node blocks are displayed and can be edited by the user as needed.
- **Marketplace**: A store where users can share or sell completed workflows, bot agents, connectors, and APIs. It aims to create an ecosystem that allows users to benefit from the collective expertise of the community.
- **Connector**: The external service and data connections, programming syntax, and expressions needed for the Studio autonomous agent to execute actions based on user context. Connectors are represented by Swagger documentation and visualized as node blocks on the Workflow Canvas. They are essential for connecting external services and data to execute user requests. In addition to core connectors, acquiring connectors for services frequently used in the local market is necessary for the Studio autonomous agent to understand and execute various user requests via natural language.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: A feature that enhances trust and control over outputs by allowing users to make immediate modifications, adjustments, and approvals within desired parameters under the supervision of the Studio autonomous agent.
