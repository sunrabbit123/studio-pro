## 1. Overview

![Intro](/studio-pro/images/docs/intro.png)

Studio Pro is a creation tool that enhances productivity by allowing users to easily build their own AI workflow apps and agents using an AI agent-based low-code builder tool. Studio Pro provides an optimal AI user experience designed to automatically perform tasks as desired by the user. Within the studio, there is an AI agent that assists throughout the entire user journey. This agent is the autonomous agent that receives user requests via natural language or voice, formulates an execution plan, and uses the provided connectors to integrate with external services and data, creating action-node-block-based workflows. After user confirmation, it can directly perform tasks.

Users can view the workflow, which represents the execution process established by the meta agent, on a low-code canvas and, if necessary, edit it to further optimize the work process or outcomes. Through these workflows, users can execute batch operations for repetitive tasks or set execution cycles. For workflows that need to be executed periodically, the results can be set as widgets on the home dashboard and updated in a feed format. Users can create multiple widget dashboards, categorized as needed.

For power users, there is an option to extract their own workflow apps and APIs and share them on the marketplace, contributing to community engagement. This series of features is suitable not only for general users but also for integration with various tools and platforms needed to enhance productivity in complex B2B environments.

## 2. Core Elements

* **Interactive and User-Friendly Interface**: The user-friendly agentic interface that allows users to communicate and view the execution process of the Studio autonomous agent in the form of a workflow.  
* **Workflow**: The execution path designed by the Studio autonomous agent to achieve the user's desired goals, broken down into actionable units.  
* **Workflow Canvas**: A drag-and-drop low-code editor that visualizes the design and action-level execution paths created by the Studio autonomous agent. Connector node blocks are displayed and can be edited by the user as needed.  
* **Marketplace**: A store where users can share or sell completed workflows, bot agents, connectors, and APIs. It aims to create an ecosystem that allows users to benefit from the collective expertise of the community.  
* **Connector**: The external service and data connections, programming syntax, and expressions needed for the Studio autonomous agent to execute actions based on user context. Connectors are represented by Swagger documentation and visualized as node blocks on the Workflow Canvas. They are essential for connecting external services and data to execute user requests. In addition to core connectors, acquiring connectors for services frequently used in the local market is necessary for the Studio autonomous agent to understand and execute various user requests via natural language.  
* **Human-in-the-loop**: A feature that enhances trust and control over outputs by allowing users to make immediate modifications, adjustments, and approvals within desired parameters under the supervision of the Studio autonomous agent.
