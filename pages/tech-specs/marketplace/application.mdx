## Application Creator
![Meta LLM Example](/images/tech-specs/meta_llm_example.png)

"Application Creator" is a service providing [Meta LLM (A.I. Chatbot)](/tech-specs/meta/preface) as an embeddable application.

When a customer purchases some OpenAPI goods from the "API marketplace" and publish them as a "Application Creator", the purchased OpenAPI operations would be utilized by the A.I. Chatbot's LLM (Large Language Model) function calling. It is the way to make a custom A.I. Chatbot with isolated sandbox environment.

Also, the "Application Creator" is an embeddable application that can be ported to the user's website or application. Therefore, the "Application Creator" is the superfast way to make a custom A.I. Chatbot. Considering the fact that the A.I. Chatbot is the most popular and useful application in the current era, the "Application Creator" is the most valuable service in the "Wrtn Studio Pro" saving costs and times for business development.

When configuring the "Application Creator" and building up a "custom A.I. Chatbot", if there are some OpenAPI goods that is not free but commercial, the customer who've created the A.I. Chatbot must pay every fees occured in the "custom A.I. Chatbot" by the API calls.

Considering aspects of the [marketplace schema](/tech-specs/marketplace/schema) and [pricing model](/tech-specs/marketplace/price) of the "API marketplace", the fee structure will be determined based on the stock and price band selected by the customer when making the final purchase, and actual charges will be made based on the number of API calls made by [LLM (Large Language Model) function calling](/tech-specs/meta/preface) in the A.I. chatbot.

For reference, the custom A.I. chatbot applications created by "Application Creator" can be resold without licensing restrictions, so if the cost of purchased OpenAPI products is burdensome for you, consider a way to pass this on to end customers.
