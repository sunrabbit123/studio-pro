Convert OpenAPI operations to migration schemas.

Before converting OpenAPI operations to LLM function calling schemas, "Wrtn Studio Pro" transforms the OpenAPI operations to an intermediate structure. The intermediate structure is called migration schema, and normalizes parameters/reponses of the OpenAPI opertion.

In other words, the migration schema is called to a helper schema for RPC (Remote Procedure Call) function conversion from OpenAPI operation. By providing noramlized definitions close to the RPC function, "Wrtn Studio Pro" can easily convert to the LLM function calling schema from the OpenAPI document.

For example, migration schema forces path parameters to have their own names, and combines query/headers to be a single object. Also, separates the response body to success and exceptional cases, and provides a description comment for the RPC function.

## Document
```typescript filename="@samchon/openapi" showLineNumbers
/**
 * Document of migration.
 *
 * The `IMigrateDocument` interface is a document of migration from
 * {@link OpenAPI.IDocument OpenAPI document} to RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
 * functions; {@link IMigrateRoute}.
 *
 * As the `IMigrateDocument` and {@link IMigrateRoute} have a lot of special
 * stories, when you're developing OpenAPI generator library, please read
 * their descriptions carefully including the description of properties.
 */
export interface IMigrateDocument<
  Schema extends OpenApi.IJsonSchema = OpenApi.IJsonSchema,
  Operation extends OpenApi.IOperation<Schema> = OpenApi.IOperation<Schema>,
> {
  /**
   * List of routes for migration.
   */
  routes: IMigrateRoute<Schema, Operation>[];

  /**
   * List of errors occurred during the migration.
   */
  errors: IMigrateDocument.IError<Operation>[];
}
export namespace IMigrateDocument {

     */
    operation: () => Operation;

    /**
     * Method of the operation.
     *
     * If the {@link OpenApi.IOperation.method} is not one of below type

```

Migration document contains only two properties. 

The first property is `routes`, a list of route schemas that has been succesfully normalized from the OpenAPI operations. The other property is `errors`, a list of target operation and its error messages occured in the normalization process.

For reference, the normalization error means that the target OpenAPI operation is not suitable for the migration process. Here is the list of reasons why the operation could be failed to normalize in the migration process:

1. Content type is not supported. Here is the list of supported content types:
   - Request Body
     - `application/json`
     - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
     - `multipart/form-data`
     - `text/plain`
   - Response Body
     - `application/json`
     - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
     - `text/plain`
  2. Headers or query parameter cannot be combined as an object
  3. Path parameters is not separated to atomic values
  4. Number of path parameters is not matched with the path



## Route

   * Instead, they would be a part of the function name. The function

### Description Comment
When transforming OpenAPI operation to migration schema, description is composed by follwing rules.

For reference, the description comment is very important to teach the purpose of the OpenAPI operation to the LLM (Large Language Model), and LLM actually determines which operation to call by the description. Therefore, the description has the highest priority.

1. Starts from the summary paragraph of the OpenAPI operation.
2. The next paragraphs are filled with the `OpenApi.IOperation.description`. By the way, if the first paragraph of `description` is same with the `summary`, it would not be duplicated.
3. Parameters' descriptions are added with `@param` tag.
4. Security requirements (`OpenApi.IOperation.security`) are added with `@security` tag.
5. Tag names are added with `@tag` tag.
6. If `OpenApi.IOperation.deprecated`, `@deprecated` tag is added.

Naming emension.

Following the OpenAPI specification, it is possible to omit the path parameter name (`IOpenApi.IOperation.IParameter.name`) in the operation schema. Furthermore, it is possible to configuring the path parameter to be optional (`IOpenApi.IOperation.IParameter.required`). 

However, as the migration schema has been designed for conversion to the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) function implementation, the parameter name must be. Also, considerinng the aspects of the RestAPI, path parameter cannot be optional.

Considering such aspects, the migration process forces the path parameter to have its own name and to be required. If the `OpenApi.IOperation.IParameter.name` is not defined, the migration process automatically deduces the name from the URL path's positional template argument analyzing. 

In the same reason, if path parameter name and actual operation's path is not matched, the migration process will emend the path parameter name by referencing the sequence of the path parameter in the URL path. Also, if path parameter name is out of variable name scope in the programming language, migration process also emends it to be a valid variable name.

To be a single object.

Considering the HTTP specification of headers and query parameters, they are always a key-value paired object. However, in the OpenAPI specification, it is possible to define headers and query parameters as separated parameters with their property names.

In the migration process, the headers and query parameters are forcibly combined to be a single object. Their object casted name is always "headers" and "query" respectively, and archived into the `IMigrateRoute.headers` and `IMigrateRoute.query` properties. 

If no headers or query parameters in the OpenAPI operation, these properties would be `null`.

To normalize the OpenAPI operation to be function like structure, the migration process separates the response body to success and exceptional cases. Also, remains only one representative content type for the request and response body.

The distinction between the successive return type and exception throwing comes from its status code. For the "POST" HTTP method, "201" status code directs the return type, and the other status codes mean `failures`. For other HTTP methods, 200 status code means the `success`.

If your HTTP operation does not follow the standard status code specification, I'm sorry but there is no way. Justturn back with the standard specification following.

### Accessor
```typescript filename="@samchon/openapi" showLineNumbers
export interface IMigrateRoute<
  Schema extends OpenApi.IJsonSchema = OpenApi.IJsonSchema,
  Operation extends OpenApi.IOperation<Schema> = OpenApi.IOperation<Schema>,
> {
  /**
   * Accessor for the route.
   *
   * The `accessor` is a list of string values that are representing how to
   * access to the OpenAPI generated RPC (Remote Procedure Call) function
   * through namespace(s).
   *
   * The `accessor` is composed with the following rules. At first, namespaces
   * are composed by static directory names in the {@link path}. Parametric
   * symbols represented by `:param` or `{param}` cannot be a part of the
   * namespace.
   *
   * Instead, they would be a part of the function name. The function
   * name is composed with the {@link method HTTP method} and parametric symbols
   * like `getByParam` or `postByParam`. If there are multiple path parameters,
   * they would be concatenated by `And` like `getByParam1AndParam2`.
   *
   * For refefence, if the {@link operation}'s {@link method} is `delete`, the
   * function name would be replaced to `erase` instead of `delete`. It is
   * the reason why the `delete` is a reserved keyword in many programming
   * languages.
   *
   * - Example 1
   *   - path: `POST /shopping/sellers/sales`
   *   - accessor: `shopping.sellers.sales.post`
   * - Example 2
   *   - endpoint: `GET /shoppings/sellers/sales/:saleId/reviews/:reviewId/comments/:id
   *   - accessor: `shoppings.sellers.sales.reviews.getBySaleIdAndReviewIdAndCommentId`
   */
  accessor: string[];
}
```

Namespace composition for RPC function conversion.

`IMigrateRoute.accessor` is a list of string values that are representing how to access to the OpenAPI generated RPC (Remote Procedure Call) function through namespace(s). The namespace is composed by static directory names in the API path. If the API path contains parametric symbols like `:param` or `{param}`, they would be excluded from the namespace composition.

By the way, as `IMigrateRoute` has been desinged to help conversion from OpenAPI operation to RPC (Remote Procedure Call) function  and the `accessor` property represents namespace of the RPC function, every string values in the `accessor` array are valid variable name in the programming language. If the OpenAPI defined path parameter names are not suitable for the variable name, the migration process replaces the parameter names to be a valid variable name.
